Welcome to the documentation for the Matryoshka server!

To get started, see the installation section below for your operating system.

## Installation

The following software should be installed on your development/deployment machine:

-   Node.js 11+
-   PHP 7.2+

Below are instructions for installation on common operating systems we've used. Keep in mind that the server is a standard PHP Laravel application, so it can just as well be installed on any other operating system following Laravel's installation instructions.

### Installation instructions for common Operating Systems

-   [Linux - Ubuntu 18.04](./installation/linux-ubuntu-18-04.md)
