Welcome to the documentation for the Matryoshka server!

## API Reference

The server provides a REST API to be used by client applications (including our own) to access application resources.

Please see the `API` section in the sidebar for all available resources. To get started, see the [**Authentication**](api/authentication) section to generate authentication credentials required to make requests to other resources.
